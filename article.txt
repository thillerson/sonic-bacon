# Sonic Bacon: Introduction to Sound Design with PureData

Last month we had a look at some basic UX principles of sound design. This month we're going to have a chance to build a sound from scratch, to get an idea of what sound design is like. We're going to use a tool called Pure Data. Pure Data is a really great software environment for digital signal processing (hereafter: DSP) including a data flow language for describing a signal flow visually.

What do I mean by building a sound from scratch? For our purposes here, I mean using software to generate an audio signal, a flow of numbers representing audible information, and then using procedures to shape the signal to get a desired sound. Before we get started, let's make sure you have the tools we'll be using.

## Installing Pure Data and Getting The Examples

You can find more information about Pure Data (hereafter Pd) at http://puredata.info, and download it from http://puredata.info/downloads. There are two flavors of Pd: Vanilla (pun intended), and Pd-extended. The vanilla distribution is the core of Pd-extended, but the extended version contains a number of useful extensions. For the examples here, I used Pd-extended, and that's easier to install anyway, so I recommend that.

If you'd like to check out the examples of the Pd files, which we call "patches", grab them from Github here: https://github.com/thillerson/sonic-bacon.

Ok, now let's get started designing a sound. First I'm going to pick out and quickly analyze a real-world sound to try to simulate. Then we'll look at how we can use Pd to create the right signal to get us started. Then we'll iterate on a patch that gets us closer and closer to the sound we want to hear.

## Making a Sound

Ok, let's make a sound! Can you think of a better sound than bacon frying up in the morning? Because I can't. Also, what with the history of Ruby and bacon and Ruby and the Prags, it's a great tie in, however tenuous. <homer voice>Mmmm...  tenuous bacon</homer voice>

The sound of bacon frying is also relatively easy to reproduce. Let's break it down and analyze what happens when bacon fries in a pan. As the bacon sits in the pan and heats up, that sizzling sound you hear is actually water in the bacon fat reaching the boiling point and exploding as thousands of little bubbles popping. Occasionally, larger pockets of steam will get trapped and build up to the point where they make a larger, louder popping sound. We could go on to describe some other characteristics, like the effect on the sound of the oil which slowly fills up the pan, or the material the pan is made out of. For this exercise, though, I think we've captured the essence of the sound if we simulate both the more frequent, smaller bubbles and the large occasional loud pop.

## The Plan

Right off the bat, there's a few characteristics of this sound to note. First, it's aperiodic, which means that there're no repeating pattern to the sound. Second is that the sound doesn't really have a tone, but is instead a series of softer or louder quick bursts of energy, or impulses.

Taking note of these two things, bells would be going off in a sound designer's head. We need something random to generate the base of this sound. It turns out there's a very common tool in the sound designer's belt for this purpose. The technical term is noise. More on that in a second.

Now that we know the main characteristics of the sound, there are other questions we want to ask. Is it high or low sounding? Is it loud or soft sounding? How does it change over time? In this case, since the size of the bubbles is very small, the sound is fairly high sounding. It's closer to a high hiss than a low rumble. It's not very loud most of the time, but every time one of the pops happen, they're louder than the rest of the bubbles. Over time as cold bacon is added to a pan and gets warmer the sizzling gets louder and changes pitch a bit as the pan fills with oil. Let's leave that more complicated model for a different time. What we'll build here is a way to get the higher pitched sound and the louder pops.

I think we have a good idea about how the sound works to get started. Now, I'll describe the steps that we can take to build a Pd patch that fulfill each one of these requirements: randomness, quick impulses, louder pops, and overall higher pitch. Let's get started by understanding the concept of noise.

## Noise: Random Sound

So, we have two primary goals for simulating this sound: one is to produce short impulses, and the second is to produce them randomly. Let's be more specific and say that we want the impulses to be random in time and loudness, not in tone.

There's a common generated sound called noise which fits the bill here. Noise is defined as a random signal. It's basically a series of impulses, again: quick bursts of energy, with random intensity (which we perceive as loudness) and random frequency (which we perceive as low or high tone). Noise is classified into different colors by how the impulses are distributed statistically over the whole range from low to high, called the frequency range. White noise has an equal distribution from low to high. Pink noise has a distribution where the intensity is inversely proportional to the frequency. There are other colors too.

White noise is so commonly used in sound generation that Pd  has a tool for producing it. Open up Pd and let's give it a try. The following steps are the ones I took to create the bacon1-noise.pd patch in the example code. You can follow along with the instructions, or just review the patch and see where we end up at the end of this step.

## Making Some Noise

Create a new document from the File > New menu item. You should have a blank window, which is where we can edit the patch. Now use Put > Object. You'll end up with a box with a dashed line around it that follows your mouse around the window. If you type in the word "noise~" and then click away, you'll end up with a solid box. This represents a Pd object. An object is like an instance of a class, where the type of the class is the name you put in the box. As long as that word corresponds to an object Pd knows about, you'll have a Pd object in the patch that you can connect with other objects to create and direct signal flows. If Pd doesn't know about the name you put in the box, for instance if you type in 'foo', which doesn't mean anything to Pd, then it will show up as a red box indicating an error.

Ok, now we have a "noise~" object. By the way, the tilde on the end of "noise~" is a Pd convention indicating that an object produces or works with a signal. A signal is a stream of data that can produce a sound, or in some cases modify another signal. So far we don't hear anything though. Create another object with Put > Object, and call this one "output~". An "output~" object is a Pd extension that allows us to send a signal to the sound card, control the volume, and also turn on and off the global DSP setting. When DSP is on, Pd will produce signals, and therefore, potentially, sound. It corresponds to the big "DSP" toggle button on Pd-extended's main window. One way to think of it is a quick kill signal. Public Service Announcement: Always make sure you take proper precautions to protect your ears when dealing with sound generation. Who knew programming could be so dangerous?

Ok, now, to listen to what noise sounds like, hover your mouse over the little dark box on the bottom of the "noise~" object. Your pointer should turn into a ring shape. This box is called an "outlet". If you drag from that box to the top-left box of the "output~" object, you'll create a connection from the "noise~" to the "output~". Drag again from the noise outlet to the top-right box of the "output~" object. There are two boxes because they correspond to your left and right speakers. Now slowly drag the volume slider on the "output~" object until you can hear the sound coming from your speakers. Sounds a bit like an old T.V. or radio tuned to an empty station, right? That's the sweet sound of even power distribution over the audible spectrum, baby!

Ok, now we have noise, which I've told you is a good building block for the sound of sizzling bacon, but we have a bit more to do before the one sounds like the other. The first thing we need to do is be a bit more selective about the noise that we allow through the speakers, so we can move away from a hissing sound to a sizzling sound.

## Sizzle

So, the problem we want to fix is that the generated noise produces many random impulses distributed across all the audible frequencies, but we want fewer and only in a certain frequency range -- the range in which we want to hear the sizzle.

To do this, we can use a filter. A filter affects sounds by excluding certain frequencies and allowing others to pass through unchanged. An equalizer on your stereo makes use of filters.

We'll use a certain type of filter called a "bandpass" filter, which will allow certain everything around a given frequency through, and cut out those on either side. To do this I placed an object after the "noise~" object and entered the text "bp~ 2000 2". This says to Pd: "Create a band pass filter, set it's center frequency to 2000 and its Q to 2".

Let's go over that again. The object "bp~" is a bandpass filter object. Pd objects also take arguments, like a function or shell command. In this case, the arguments are 2000 and 2, separated by a space. 2000 sets the center frequency to 2 kilohertz, or 2000 cycles per second, roughly midway into the audible frequencies. The Q value specifies how quickly to attenuate, or gradually "turn down" the frequencies on either side of the center, making a bell shape. A Q of 2 is fairly broad, so the filter will let a wide band around the center frequency through.

If you want to hear what this sounds like, connect the "noise~" to the filter and the filter to the "output~". It sounds a lot closer to what we want. Let's cut down on the number of impulses just a little bit more by disconnecting the filter from the outlet.

To do this select Edit > Edit Mode from the menu, select a connection line going from "noise~" to "output~" and press delete. Select and delete the other line, too. Edit Mode is a toggle in Pd, which switches between a mode where you can select and move objects and a "performance" mode where you can interact with objects. In Edit Mode when hovering over an object, your mouse pointer will turn into a pointing hand.

Now continue by adding below the "noise~" object an object with the text "max~ 0.2" and then another object after that with "-~ 0.2" (minus-tilde). Then connect the filter to the "max~", the "max~" to the "-~", and the "-~" to both sides of the "output~". That sounds even closer to a sizzling sound.

What we did here was to use the "max~" object to only allow the signal from the filter through when the amplitude was above 0.2 (where 1 is the highest and -1 the lowest value). This will cut out frequencies below 0.2, and keep all the amplitudes positive. Since we did that, we want to subtract 0.2 with a "-~" to "re-center" the wave to where the lowest amplitude is 0, not 0.2.

It might make it a little clearer if we look at graphs of the noise, the filtered noise, and then the signal with a max of 0.2, recentered.

[editor: I have a pdf image to go here]

That sounds a lot more like a sizzling pan of bacon. Next step, let's add pops for an even more realistic sound.

## Pop

To get the popping sound what we'll do is just duplicate what we did for the sizzle, but with some different parameters for a slightly different sound.

First, though, disconnect the "output~" and move it to the side. After the "-~ 0.2" create an object: "throw~ out" and connect the "-~ 0.2" to it. Then above the "output~" add an object containing "catch~ out". The throw/catch pattern is a common way to clean up Pd patches that require multiple connections. Signals are sent from one or more named "throw~" objects to a correspondingly named "catch~" object, avoiding a bunch of connections all over the screen.

Now side by side with the stack of objects already in the patch, add objects with these names and arguments: "bp~ 500 0.8", "max~ 0.7", "-~ 0.7". This will take the same noise, but filter with a bandpass filter centered at 500 Hz with a Q of 0.8, take only frequencies above 0.7, and recenter that new signal. This will produce a popping noise when everything is connected up. First, though, to make it stand out a bit from the sizzling noise, let's turn it up a bit. Add an object with the text "*~ 12" (thats asterisk-tilde 12) below the signal subtraction object. This is a signal multiplier object. Multiplying a signal makes it louder. Finally, add another "throw~ out" below the multiplier. 

[editor: I have a pdf image to put here]

Now we have a pretty good simulation of bacon frying. Let's take one more step to improve the sound, and then take stock of where we are and what we've learned.

## Finishing Up

Listening to the sound we're producing so far, it's just a little off. It's a little too low-sounding. To clean this up we'll use another filter, a high-pass filter. A high pass filter allows frequencies above a certain point through, and attenuates lower frequencies. This would be like turning the bass all the way down on your radio.

To add this object, disconnect the "catch~ out" object and put an object with the text "hip~ 2200" between the "catch~" and the "output~". Listen to it and see if it doesn't sound a little more like what we want. If you'd like, edit the frequency, but switching to edit mode and double-clicking inside the "hip~" object to change the argument.

## Recap

So what we learned is that we can use Pd to make some realistic effects. We created a bacon sizzling effect by starting with noise, subtracting away some frequencies we didn't want to hear, and then finally tuning it a little bit to what we wanted to hear more of. 

Sound design is a lot of fun on its own, and it can add some magic to apps and games that you're producing. I hope this article helped you get an idea of how it works and interests you in giving it a try.
